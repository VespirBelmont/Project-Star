Press Up to see the developer!
Did you know if you press start, the game will start!
I added this message because I love Minecraft
I've been playing Minecraft since Alpha 1!
You can't beat this game yet >:D
There's 2 planned expansions!
The dodge thruster mod for wings is great for mobility!
Try out the ram buster frame mod if you like ramming!
